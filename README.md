# Homelab Kubernetes

## Overview

This repository contains the configuration of my personal Kubernetes homelab, designed to reproduce a secure, observable, and automated platform following GitOps principles.

The lab demonstrates a realistic end-to-end setup including:

* FluxCD for declarative GitOps automation
* Vault for secret management and dynamic credentials
* Kyverno and Cosign for policy enforcement and image signing
* Harbor and Trivy for registry security and vulnerability scanning
* CloudNative-PG for resilient database operations and backups
* Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana for observability

Each component integrates into a coherent, production-like workflow focused on security, automation, and clarity.
